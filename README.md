# 🌙 LunaExplorer

**LunaExplorer** is a retro-styled web browser built entirely in Python, inspired by the classic **Windows XP “Luna” aesthetic**.  
It’s a project focused on blending *nostalgia, creativity, and modern code* — bringing back that early-2000s charm with a dash of modern Python magic.

This project started by following the book [Web Browser Engineering](https://browser.engineering/) by Pavel Panchekha & Chris Harrelson

## 🧠 About the Project

LunaExplorer isn’t meant to compete with Chrome or Firefox — it’s meant to **feel** like an experience from another time.  
Think glossy buttons, soft blue gradients, and window chrome that actually has personality.

You’ll be able to:
- 🪩 Browse the web using Python’s `PyQt5` or `PySide6` WebEngine
- 🧩 Customize the UI with authentic XP-era visuals
- 🪄 Add extensions or experimental “shell” integrations
- 💾 Save pages locally in a vintage file explorer view

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

The **Windows XP Luna theme** — bright, bubbly, and unapologetically blue.  
LunaExplorer aims to capture that nostalgic interface with:
- Rounded window edges  
- Classic toolbar icons  
- Gradient title bars  
- Hoverable, tactile buttons  
- Optional *Silver* and *Olive Green* themes
